# Web Extension Preact Typescript Starter

> Extensions can extend and modify the capability of a browser. Extensions for Firefox are built using the WebExtensions API, a cross-browser system for developing extensions. To a large extent the system is compatible with the extension API supported by Google Chrome and Opera and the W3C Draft Community Group. Extensions written for these browsers will in most cases run in Firefox or Microsoft Edge with just a few changes. - [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions)

Like the title has kind of given away, this is a simple starter template for Web Extensions. I've found Preact to be an exceptional fit for Web Extensions due to it's compact size, and small but adequate API.

This starter does not include a state management library. If you would like a light weight solution, you can take a look at [preact-context](https://github.com/valotas/preact-context). Otherwise, a framework-agnostic one like [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) also works.

The following technologies are used:

- ⚛️ Preact
- 🖋 TypeScript
- 🃏 Jest
- 💅 Styled Components

The usage of these frameworks/libraries is probably overkill for very small extensions (but the DX is oh-so-good 😎).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the finished extension.

### Prerequisites

- Node: version >= 8.0.0
- npm: version >= 6.0.0

All other necessary development dependencies will be installed when you run `npm install` in the root directory.

### Installing

1.  Clone the repository.

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
